## About the project 🎯 

### Explanation

This project consists of a Dashboard Pannel where the administrator can perform actions such as Creating, Reading, Updating and 
Deleting people and companies. The administrator has available two pannels, 
one for people and one for companies where he can carry out these actions. 
The dashboard is connected to an API developed in Node.js and a database in SQLITE. 
The interface was designed on Figma, and then developed using HTML5, CSS3 , Bootstrap and Javascript. 
The main idea was to develop a website focusing on the integration between Front-end
and Back-end, including CRUD operations in SQLITE. 

### What I learned? 

Throughout the development of this project, I learned a lot of Back-end concepts, such as development
of API and routes, establishing connection with database and performing CRUD operations, integrating with Front-end and basic concepts of servers. 
On the Front-end, I learned how to apply Bootstrap in conjunct with CSS; That was my first time using Bootstrap. I successfully created a responsive 
and fluid website for all devices. And the most important, API consuming on the Front-end.
